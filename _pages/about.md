I am a first-year Master's student in Computer Science at UC San Diego. I have received my Bachelor's in Engineering at Beihang Univerisity in 2024.

My reserach interest in AI lies on Machine Learning, Neural Architecture Search and Reasoning. I also interested in incorporating AI in neuroscience, including using view got in the learning algorithm to understand human brain and utilizes the insight got in the cognition to study the machine learning, such as brain decoding (former) and cognitive architecture (latter). I've published a paper on arXiv titled [Double-Flow GAN model for the reconstruction of perceived faces from brain activities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.07478.pdf) coorperated with Prof. [Hui Zhang](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/zhanghui2/zh_CN/index.htm)
