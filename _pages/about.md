I am a senior undergraduate student in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University. I will be receiving my Bachelor's in Engineering in 2024. Currently, I'm working with Prof. [Hui Zhang](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/zhanghui2/zh_CN/index.htm)

My reserach interest in AI lies on generative model, reasoning in vision & multimodal and scene understanding. I also interested in incorporating AI in neuroscience, including using view got in the learning algorithm to understand human brain and utilizes the insight got in the cognition to study the machine learning, such as brain decoding (former) and cognitive architecture (latter). I've published a paper on arXiv titled [Double-Flow GAN model for the reconstruction of perceived faces from brain activities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.07478.pdf)
