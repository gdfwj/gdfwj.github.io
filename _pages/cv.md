Research experience
======
* Apr. 2023-Jun. 2024: Reconstruction of brain-perceived images
  * Mentor: associate research fellow Hui Zhang, Beihang University; research group: five students
  * Designed and trained a model to reconstruct the face image perceived in brain from fMRI data.
  * Implemented a pre-training strategy on the CelebA dataset, utilizing the features extracted by VGGFace as conditions, as a solution to the scarcity of fMRI-face paired data 
  * Designed a double-flow architecture of the discriminator for GAN to challenge the generator.
  * Prepare to submit on MICCAI’24 (Independent First Author), will be published on arxiv this December.

* Jun.-Aug. 2023: Migration of Trajectory Prediction from Pytorch to Mindspore Framework in Libcity (Independent)
  * Mentor: Prof. Jingyuan Wang, Director of Data Intelligence Research Center
  * Transferred Pytorch codes of Libcity to Mindspore frame, adjusted and optimized the codes, achieving the improvement of effect from 0.14 to 0.15 on top1 acc, and 0.28 to 0.35 on top5 acc.
  * Learned to read the trajectory prediction model in Libcity, repeated and optimized it. 
  * Found, solved and reported the bug in RNN module of Mindspore 
  * Learned to build a complex network structure and to process complex original data.

* Oct. 2021-Mar.2022: Deep Learning-based Algorithms for Interpretable Painter Recognition
  * Mentor: Associate Professor Li Ruan, Beihang University; research group: two students
  * Built a dataset that included the works by both Chinese and foreign multi-style painters and labeled painters, modified ResNet50 for classification, and analyzed the interpretability of the results with Grad-CAM++.
  * Achieved 80.06% accuracy in the classification algorithm and passed the interpretable result verification.
  * Awarded the 3rd prize in the Production Team, Fengru Cup Competition Main Track.
  * Cultivated my ability to conduct research, enhanced my academic reading capacity, and my ability to write papers in both Chinese and English.
